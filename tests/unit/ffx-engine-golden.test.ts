/**
 * **FFX engine goldens**: every listed FFX chapter, two seeds each, played by the chapter's own
 * line through its whole chain; the digest of every link's full event log (JSON, every field) is
 * pinned. Written before `src/battle/ffx/engine.ts` was split under the 400-line house limit
 * (advisor v4, 2026-09-28), so the split is proved to change nothing (AGENTS.md rules 3 and 7).
 *
 * A digest that moves means the engine's behaviour moved: that is a change to explain, never a
 * number to re-pin without a reason.
 *
 * Game case: FFX only (the FFX-2 engine has `ffx2-atb-golden.test.ts`).

/**
 * Recorded on advisor-v4 at cf3306eb (main 1a81a8ed merged), before the split. Chapters II
 * (Yunalesca) and III (Braska's Final Aeon) re-pinned 2026-09-29 in main's merge of advisor-v4: D-274
 * (578e7f22, research §6.4.3's aeon rows for II and III) moves exactly these four digests, proved by
 * running this file on 578e7f22^ (18/18) and 578e7f22 (these four values, the other 14 unchanged).
 * Chapter III re-pinned again 2026-09-30 by r34fix-odfail (FFX only): a failed Swordplay/Bushido now
 * resolves its sourced Fail row (research §5.3, §5.5). The line's auto-rolled Energy Rain fails once
 * in link 6 of seed 1 and once in link 6 of seed 7 and now deals 20 DmgCon instead of 26, which moves
 * exactly those links' digests (and seed 7's link 7, which starts from link 6's end state); every
 * outcome is still victory, and with the fail wiring stubbed out this file is 18/18 on the old values.
 * Chapters II and III re-pinned 2026-10-01 by r34fix-od5 (FFX only): a clean Bushido now picks its
 * (Immune) row per target from the target's own immunities (research §5.5; Bailey D-310/D-311). Every
 * moved digest is an auto-rolled successful Shooting Star on an Eject-immune target now dealing 27
 * DmgCon instead of 24: Yunalesca (seeds 1 and 7, link 1), Possessed Valefor (link 2 of both seeds)
 * and Braska's Final Aeon (seed 7, link 1). Old and new trees replayed side by side; no other digest
 * moved and every outcome is unchanged.
 * Chapter VII (Anima, Macalania) re-pinned 2026-10-03 by r37-small (PR-0258, FFX only): an overkill now doubles
 * the killed enemy's item drops (research ffx-vs-ffx2-presentation §9; `results.ts#OVERKILL_DROP_MULTIPLIER`).
 * The line overkills a Guado Guardian on both seeds, so the victory event's drops change and nothing else:
 * with the multiplier stubbed to 1 this file is 18/18 on the old values, and the other 16 digests never moved.
 * All 18 digests re-baselined 2026-10-08 by re-parity W1 ("game-code parity", FFX only): the hit roll, the damage
 * variance, the critical roll and the damage chain now come from the kernels proven against FFX.exe
 * (src/battle/ffx/kernel/), through src/battle/ffx/adapt/ and hit-apply.ts, drawn in the game's order (hit, variance,
 * critical; targets outer, hits inner) and fed the game's own command flags (src/data/ffx/command-records/). Every
 * log moves because the draw order and the formulas moved, which is the point, and
 * tests/unit/parity-ffx-engine-wiring.test.ts is the proof that the engine computes what the kernels compute. Four
 * outcomes moved, all on seeds that were not tuned: seymour-flux#7 victory -> defeat (Cross Cleave never misses in
 * the game's record), seymour-omnis#1 victory -> defeat, seymour-natus#1 and #7 defeat -> victory; the other 14 keep
 * their outcome. The per-chapter causes are in docs/handoff/re-parity-w1.md. The old values are in git history (the
 * commit before the one that moved them).
 * Chapter III re-baselined a second time the same day, same track (FFX only): the five possessed aeons' plain Attack runs
 * on the game's monster-side record 0x6000 (accuracy formula 2 on a byte of 90, physical, cannot crit) and not on the
 * party's Attack record, so about half of it misses, as the record says (the old engine never missed). That moves the
 * digests of the links where a possessed aeon attacks (seed 1: links 5 to 7; seed 7: links 3 to 7); every outcome is still
 * victory and no other digest moved.
 * Chapters I, VII, X and XII re-baselined 2026-10-09 by re-parity AI-Seymour ("game-script parity", FFX only): Seymour
 * Flux and the Mortiorchis, Seymour with the Guado Guardians and Anima, Seymour Natus with Mortibody, and Seymour Omnis
 * with the Mortiphasm discs now follow the game's own compiled scripts (research/re-ffx-ai-seymour.md, rows D-01 to D-33):
 * the shared cycle state, the hooks that run once per action per target before the death check, the revive values, the
 * formation start hooks, the Desperado ladder, the disc ring and the affinity timing. These eight digests (seeds 1 and 7 of
 * those four chapters) move because every enemy turn and every hook of those fights moved; the other ten (Chapters II, III,
 * VIII, IX and XIV) are byte for byte what they were. Five outcomes moved on seeds nobody tuned: seymour-flux#1 and #7
 * defeat -> victory, seymour-natus#7 victory -> defeat, seymour-omnis#1 defeat -> victory and #7 victory -> defeat; the
 * 500-seed tables and their causes are in docs/handoff/re-parity-ai-seymour.md. Nothing on the boss or the party was tuned.
